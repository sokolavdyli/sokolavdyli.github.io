Load Balancer Solution With Apache
===========================

When we access a website on the Internet using an URL, we don't necessarily know how many servers are handling our requests. This complexity is concealed from regular users. However, for heavily visited websites like Google or Reddit, serving all users from a single Web Server becomes impossible. This concept also applies to databases.

Each URL consists of a domain name part that gets translated (resolved) to the IP address of a target server responsible for serving requests upon opening a website on the Internet. The translation (resolution) of domain names is carried out by DNS servers. One of the most commonly used DNS servers has a public IP address of 8.8.8.8 and belongs to Google. You can test it by querying it with the nslookup command.

```
[azureuser@Project1-Webserver2 ~]$ nslookup 8.8.8.8
8.8.8.8.in-addr.arpa    name = dns.google.

After completing a previous project, blog post 1, you might be curious about how a user accesses each of the webservers using three different IP addresses or three different DNS names. You might also question the purpose of having three distinct servers performing identical tasks.

Let's examine the revised solution architecture, now featuring an added LB atop the Web Servers. For simplicity, let's assume it's a software L7 Application LB, such as Apache, NGINX, or HAProxy.

In this project, our aim is to improve our Tooling Website solution by introducing a Load Balancer. This addition will enable traffic distribution between Web Servers and provide users with access to our website via a single URL.

We have to deploy and set up an Apache Load Balancer for the Tooling Website solution on a distinct Ubuntu EC2 instance. Ensure users can be served by the Web servers through this Load Balancer.

To simplify matters, we'll implement this solution with 2 Web Servers, but the approach will remain consistent for 3 or more Web Servers.

For the Load Balancer server, we will deploy a new instance on Azure, an Ubuntu Server 20.04. Once your VM is up and running, always do:

`sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y`
