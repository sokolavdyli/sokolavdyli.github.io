Load Balancer Solution With Apache
===========================

When we access a website on the Internet using an URL, we don't necessarily know how many servers are handling our requests. This complexity is concealed from regular users. However, for heavily visited websites like Google or Reddit, serving all users from a single Web Server becomes impossible. This concept also applies to databases.

Each URL consists of a domain name part that gets translated (resolved) to the IP address of a target server responsible for serving requests upon opening a website on the Internet. The translation (resolution) of domain names is carried out by DNS servers. One of the most commonly used DNS servers has a public IP address of 8.8.8.8 and belongs to Google. You can test it by querying it with the nslookup command.

```
[azureuser@Project1-Webserver2 ~]$ nslookup 8.8.8.8
8.8.8.8.in-addr.arpa    name = dns.google.

After completing a previous project, blog post 1, you might be curious about how a user accesses each of the webservers using three different IP addresses or three different DNS names. You might also question the purpose of having three distinct servers performing identical tasks.

Let's examine the revised solution architecture, now featuring an added LB atop the Web Servers. For simplicity, let's assume it's a software L7 Application LB, such as Apache, NGINX, or HAProxy.

In this project, our aim is to improve our Tooling Website solution by introducing a Load Balancer. This addition will enable traffic distribution between Web Servers and provide users with access to our website via a single URL.

We have to deploy and set up an Apache Load Balancer for the Tooling Website solution on a distinct Ubuntu EC2 instance. Ensure users can be served by the Web servers through this Load Balancer.

To simplify matters, we'll implement this solution with 2 Web Servers, but the approach will remain consistent for 3 or more Web Servers.

For the Load Balancer server, we will deploy a new instance on Azure, an Ubuntu Server 20.04. Once your VM is up and running, always do:

`sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y`

- Now, open TCP port 80 on your VM by creating an Inbound Rule in Security Group.
- Configure the LoadBalancer server by installing Apache Load Balancer and setting it up to direct incoming traffic from LB to both Web Servers :

```
#Install apache2
sudo apt install apache2 -y
sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev

#Enable following modules:
sudo a2enmod rewrite
sudo a2enmod proxy
sudo a2enmod proxy_balancer
sudo a2enmod proxy_http
sudo a2enmod headers
sudo a2enmod lbmethod_bytraffic

#Restart apache2 service
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

Check if the just installed apache2 is running: 

`sudo systemctl status apache2`

if you see something like this it means it's running properly:

It's time to configure out Load Balancer; in our case Private IP's are 10.0.0.4 and 10.0.0.5 for webservers.

```
sudo vi /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf

#Add this configuration into this section <VirtualHost *:80>  </VirtualHost>

<Proxy "balancer://mycluster">
               BalancerMember http://<WebServer1-Private-IP-Address>:80 loadfactor=5 timeout=1
               BalancerMember http://<WebServer2-Private-IP-Address>:80 loadfactor=5 timeout=1
               ProxySet lbmethod=bytraffic
               # ProxySet lbmethod=byrequests
        </Proxy>

        ProxyPreserveHost On
        ProxyPass / balancer://mycluster/
        ProxyPassReverse / balancer://mycluster/

#Restart apache server

sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

Once you have done the above config, go checkout your loadbalancers public IP:

`http://<Load-Balancer-Public-IP-Address-or-Public-DNS-Name>/index.php`

You should be reaching out to your app just like you reach out through your webservers public IP's. 

Note: If in the previous blog, I told you to mount /var/log/httpd/ from your Web Servers to the NFS server â€“ unmount them and make sure that each Web Server has its own log directory. 

`umount -f /var/log/httpd`

in case of error please stop httpd service first then use above umount action, then restart httpd.

Now is the fun part, to verify all you did is working properly, open two ssh sessions for both Web Servers and run following command:

`sudo tail -f /var/log/httpd/access_log`

If you refresh your browser page, using the URL "http:///Your-Load-Balancer/index.php," multiple times, you should observe that both servers are receiving HTTP GET requests. Check the log files of each server to confirm the appearance of new records. Because we've set the loadfactor to the same value for both servers, the distribution of traffic will be even, resulting in approximately equal requests to each server.

When everything is correctly configured, your users won't notice that their requests are being handled by more than one server, ensuring a seamless experience.

Everything we did, in the big picture looks like this.
