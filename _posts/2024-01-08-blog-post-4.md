LOAD BALANCER SOLUTION WITH NGINX AND SSL/TLS
==========================

To be a versatile DevOps engineer, one must understand various solutions for common problems. In our previous blog post, we explored Load Balancing using Apache. However, in this post, we'll delve into configuring an Nginx Load Balancer solution, expanding our toolkit.

Security is paramount in ensuring encrypted connections for web solutions. The use of secured HTTP (HTTPS protocol) is essential. We'll discuss its significance and the necessary steps to implement it, safeguarding data from potential interception during transmission over the Internet.

Data transferred between a client (browser) and a web server faces threats from interception if left unencrypted. Man-In-The-Middle (MIMT) attacks exploit this vulnerability through intermediate network devices. Users sharing sensitive information via non-secured channels risk compromising their data to cybercriminals.

SSL/TLS technology provides a shield against MITM attacks by establishing encrypted sessions between browsers and web servers. Though SSL has been succeeded by TLS, the term SSL/TLS is commonly used to refer to this family of cryptographic protocols.

Digital certificates play a crucial role in SSL/TLS, validating and identifying websites. Browsers verify these certificates issued by Certificate Authorities (CAs) to ensure a website's trustworthiness and registration with the CA.

Our project involves registering our Tooling website (learningdevops.online) with LetsEncrypt, a Certificate Authority. Automating certificate issuance will be achieved using the LetsEncrypt-recommended shell client, cetrbot. This approach ensures a secure and trusted connection for our web platform.

So basically we will have two main tasks for this deployment: 

1. Configure our LB as Nginx Server
2. Register new domain, we have already one registered for testing (sorry if you see it offline you might be reading this when servers are powered off), 
learningdevops.online, and configure secured connection using SSL/TLS certificates. The updated architecture would look like this:
