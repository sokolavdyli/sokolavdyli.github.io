LOAD BALANCER SOLUTION WITH NGINX AND SSL/TLS
==========================

To be a versatile DevOps engineer, one must understand various solutions for common problems. In our previous blog post, we explored Load Balancing using Apache. However, in this post, we'll delve into configuring an Nginx Load Balancer solution, expanding our toolkit.

Security is paramount in ensuring encrypted connections for web solutions. The use of secured HTTP (HTTPS protocol) is essential. We'll discuss its significance and the necessary steps to implement it, safeguarding data from potential interception during transmission over the Internet.

Data transferred between a client (browser) and a web server faces threats from interception if left unencrypted. Man-In-The-Middle (MIMT) attacks exploit this vulnerability through intermediate network devices. Users sharing sensitive information via non-secured channels risk compromising their data to cybercriminals.

SSL/TLS technology provides a shield against MITM attacks by establishing encrypted sessions between browsers and web servers. Though SSL has been succeeded by TLS, the term SSL/TLS is commonly used to refer to this family of cryptographic protocols.

Digital certificates play a crucial role in SSL/TLS, validating and identifying websites. Browsers verify these certificates issued by Certificate Authorities (CAs) to ensure a website's trustworthiness and registration with the CA.

Our project involves registering our Tooling website (learningdevops.online) with LetsEncrypt, a Certificate Authority. Automating certificate issuance will be achieved using the LetsEncrypt-recommended shell client, cetrbot. This approach ensures a secure and trusted connection for our web platform.

So basically we will have two main tasks for this deployment: 

1. Configure our LB as Nginx Server
2. Register new domain, we have already one registered for testing (sorry if you see it offline you might be reading this when servers are powered off), 
learningdevops.online, and configure secured connection using SSL/TLS certificates. The updated architecture would look like this:

![](/images/nginxLB/architecture.png)

For out scenario, we will be deleting old LB and create a new one (better to have a fresh server), and name it LB-Nginx. It's based on Ubuntu 20.04. Also, once your server is deployed please open TCP port 443 on Network Security Settings for secure connection - HTTPS).

Install Nginx:
```
apt update -y && apt upgrade -y
apt install nginx
```
Start Nginx:
`enable nginx && systemctl start nginx`

Check nginx status by running:
`systemctl status nginx`

and you should see something similar:

![](/images/nginxLB/nginxstartstatus.png)

Next we have to edit the following file:

`nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/load_balancer.conf`

and paste this script:

```
#insert following configuration into http section

 upstream myproject {
    server 98.66.154.31 weight=5;
    server 98.66.161.150 weight=5;
  }

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name learningdevops.online www.learningdevops.online;
    location / {
      proxy_pass http://myproject;
    }
  }

#comment out this line
#       include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;
```

The **server** IPs should be your Webservers Public IP's, in our case we have two, thats why we have a LB to manage traffic load on both servers.
The **server_name** should be your domain, that you have registered on a any Domain Registring service, like Namecheap, or Goddady. 

Now, we have to remove the default parge file from site-available directory so our reverse proxy will redirect to our domain.

`rm -f /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default`

You can test your configuration syntax if its ok by runing `nginx -t`

Go back to sites-enabled directory and link our balancer config file that we just created to our site-enabled so our nginx can access our configuration through it.

```
 cd /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
 ln -s ../sites-available/load_balancer.conf .
```
verify by running *ll* command and you'll see something similar:

![](/images/nginxLB/linkedconf.png)

Restart nginx service `systemctl restart nginx` and verify its active status `systemctl status nginx`

We'll come back to our LB later for certbot install but now let's go do the Domain registration and Azure DNZ Zone Creation.

First, go to Azure portal, and search for DNS Zones. 

![](/images/azure/dnszone.png)

Once your DNS Zone is deployed, grab the Name Servers and add to your Domain configuration, in our case, we are using Namecheap, so follow these steps if you choose Namecheap too:

Under domain List, click manage for your domain, and at name servers choose Custom DNS. Add your NS from the Azure DNS Zone.

After this, go to Record Set in DNS Zone Azure, and add 2 records sets:
**1<sup>st</sup>** your Load Balancers Public IP copy and past at IP address section
**2<sup>nd</sup>** your Load Balancers public IP copy and paste at IP Adress section, and put *www* at Name section.

<span style="color:red"> **Please note that since we are doing this for testing purposes, we are not using Elastic IP. Otherwise, your LoadBalancer VM should have a Elastic IP so it doesnt change in case your provider decides to release it or renew.** </span>

If you DNS zone overview looks similar to this, you are most probably doing it right.

Until now, if you have done all the steps, go check your domain and it should direct you to your webserver app, in our case the Tooling app. Congrats ;)

#CONFIGURE SECURED CONNECTION USING SSL/TLS CERTIFICATES.

We need to configure our connection using SSL/TLS certificate as we said at the beginning to ecrypt the information in transit. So, we will be using certbot and its suggested dependency by installing it with the command:

```
apt install certbot -y
apt install python3-certbot-nginx -y
```

once done, check if the nginx syntax is ok and reload
`nginx -t && nginx -s reload`

Now we need to create a certificate for our domain, which will make it secure:

`certbot --nginx -d <your-domain.com> -d <your-domain.com>`

Next you will be prompted with some required information for your domain to have a valid certificate from the Certificate Authority, please answer the questions with your details (real email address).

One you have answered the questions properly, please refresh your webpage and you will see that your connection to the domain is secure.

![](/images/azure/certificate.png)

Test the login to your Tooling webpage and if you have followed the steps above properly, you should be all set. 

The SSL/TLS certificates from LetsEncrypt are valid 90 days, so if you are deploying your real project, then you need to make sure to renew the certificate at least every 60 days or more frequently.

Best practice is to have a cronjob, scheduled to run a command periodically, for example at the beginning of each month:

`crontab -e`

Choose your editor and then paste this line at the end and this will make your cert renew at midnight (00:00) on the 1st day of every month.

`0 0 1 * * /usr/bin/certbot renew > /dev/null 2>&1`

###Thank you for your time reading this documentation.
