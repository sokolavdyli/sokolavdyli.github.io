3-tier Web App Architecture
===========================

Hi,

Today we'll go through implementing a 3-tier web app architecture with a single Database and a NFS Server as a shared file storage as below:

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*SAySANG_2_7qjWaKPocBQQ.png)

To implement this solution we are going to use following components:

1.  Infrastructure: Microsoft Azure
2.  Webserver Linux: RHEL 8 (3 instances)
3.  Database Server: Ubuntu 20.04 + MySQL
4.  Storage Server: RHEL8 NFS Server
5.  Programming Language: PHP

ΓÇö First of all, we create our needed resources on Azure Portal:

Running 5 instances for the project

So now, what we will do is to create 10G volumes and attach to our NFS Server. The focus of this part is to show practical experience of working with disks, partitions and volumes in Linux.

We login into NFS server and we see that 3x 10G volumes have been attached into server

Using gdisk tool we create partition on each disks

```
sudo gdisk /dev/sdc  
sudo gdisk /dev/sdd  
sudo gdisk /dev/sde
```

So below I will show the creation of partition of only one disk and the procedure is same for the others

```
\[root@NFS azureuser\]# gdisk /dev/sdd  
GPT fdisk (gdisk) version 0.8.10  
  
Partition table scan:  
  MBR: not present  
  BSD: not present  
  APM: not present  
  GPT: not present  
  
Creating new GPT entries.  
  
Command (? for help): n  
Partition number (1-128, default 1): 1  
First sector (34-20971486, default = 2048) or {+-}size{KMGTP}:  
Last sector (2048-20971486, default = 20971486) or {+-}size{KMGTP}:  
Current type is 'Linux filesystem'  
Hex code or GUID (L to show codes, Enter = 8300): 8300  
Changed type of partition to 'Linux filesystem'  
  
Command (? for help): p  
Disk /dev/sdd: 20971520 sectors, 10.0 GiB  
Logical sector size: 512 bytes  
Disk identifier (GUID): 069C0B86-FA7F-4A6B-86C7-5F510E6308A4  
Partition table holds up to 128 entries  
First usable sector is 34, last usable sector is 20971486  
Partitions will be aligned on 2048-sector boundaries  
Total free space is 2014 sectors (1007.0 KiB)  
  
Number  Start (sector)    End (sector)  Size       Code  Name  
   1            2048        20971486   10.0 GiB    8300  Linux filesystem  
  
Command (? for help): w  
  
Final checks complete. About to write GPT data. THIS WILL OVERWRITE EXISTING  
PARTITIONS!!  
  
Do you want to proceed? (Y/N): y  
OK; writing new GUID partition table (GPT) to /dev/sdd.  
The operation has completed successfully.
```

So now when we do the lsblk command we will see something like this:

New partitions on each disk

Next thing we have to install LVM2 package using sudo yum install lvm2 -y command. After its installed , using LVM we will creat physical volumes.

_use 'sudo' if you are not a root user._

```
sudo pvcreate /dev/sdc1  
sudo pvcreate /dev/sdd1  
sudo pvcreate /dev/sde1  
sudo pvs
```physical volumes creation

Now we have to add them to a Volume Groups, in our case we are naming it nfs-vg:

```
sudo vgcreate nfs-vg /dev/sdc1 /dev/sdd1 /dev/sde1  
sudo vgs
```Volume Group created

Now weΓÇÖll create 3 Logical Volumes ΓÇö **lv-opt** ; **lv-apps**, and **lv-logs**

```
sudo lvcreate -n lv-apps -L 9G nfs-vg  
sudo lvcreate -n lv-logs -L 9G nfs-vg  
sudo lvcreate -n lv-opt -L 9G nfs-vg    // this one wont be used in this scenario but I prepared for future projects ;)   
sudo lvs
```

So, now we have the Logical Volumes ready using LVM, now we need to format the volumes using xfs filesystem that is optimized for larg files transfers.

```
sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/nfs-vg/lv-apps  
sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/nfs-vg/lv-logs  
sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/nfs-vg/lv-opt
```

Now we will create mount points on /mnt directory for logical volumes as follow:

> lv-apps mount on /mnt/apps
> 
> lv-logs mount on /mnt/logs
> 
> lv-opt mount on /mnt/opt ΓÇö to be used by Jenkins server in future projects.

```
cd /mnt  
sudo mkdir apps && mkdir logs && mkdir opt  
  
\# and then mount the logical volumes  
sudo mount /dev/nfs-vg/lv-apps /mnt/apps  
sudo mount /dev/nfs-vg/lv-logs /mnt/logs  
sudo mount /dev/nfs-vg/lv-opt /mnt/opt
```

After this run _sudo yum -y update_ and letΓÇÖs jump on to DB server to prepare while NFS server is updated.

Once you login into DB server since its a fresh VM, run here _sudo yum -y update && sudo yum -y upgrade_ and _then sudo apt install mysql-server._ Note here we are using **apt** instead of **yum** since this DB server is running on Ubuntu.

Now we create database and name it **tooling** and a db user name it **webaccess**. We grant permission on **webaccess** user on **tooling** database to do anything only from the webservers subnet cidr.

```
sudo mysql  
CREATE DATABASE tooling;  
CREATE USER 'webaccess'@'10.0.0.0/16' identified by 'password';  
grant all privileges on tooling.\* to 'webaccess'@'10.0.0.0/16';  
flush privileges;
```

Jumping back to NFS server to continue configuration and rebooting:

```
sudo yum install nfs-utils -y  
sudo systemctl start nfs-server.service  
sudo systemctl enable nfs-server.service  
sudo systemctl status nfs-server.service
```once you run above commands youΓÇÖll see this output

Now, make sure we set up permission that will allow our Web servers to read, write and execute files on NFS:

```
sudo chown -R nobody: /mnt/apps  
sudo chown -R nobody: /mnt/logs  
sudo chown -R nobody: /mnt/opt  
  
sudo chmod -R 777 /mnt/apps  
sudo chmod -R 777 /mnt/logs  
sudo chmod -R 777 /mnt/opt  
  
sudo systemctl restart nfs-server.service
```

After this, we configure access to NFS for clients within the same subnet (example of Subnet CIDR ΓÇö 10.0.0.0/16):

```
sudo vi /etc/exports  
  
/mnt/apps 10.0.0.0/16(rw,sync,no\_all\_squash,no\_root\_squash)  
/mnt/logs 10.0.0.0/16(rw,sync,no\_all\_squash,no\_root\_squash)  
/mnt/opt 10.0.0.0/16(rw,sync,no\_all\_squash,no\_root\_squash)  
  
Esc + :wq!  
  
sudo exportfs -arv
```

Now check which port is used by NFS and open it using Security Groups (inbound rule on your VM). Also, In order for NFS server to be accessible from your client, you must also open following ports: TCP 111, UDP 111, UDP 2049

*   LetΓÇÖs start with the Web Servers configuration, first with WebServer 1:

We need to make sure that our Web Servers can serve the same content from shared storage solutions, in our case ΓÇö NFS Server and MySQL database.

You already know that one DB can be accessed for **reads** and **writes** by multiple clients. For storing shared files that our Web Servers will use ΓÇö we will utilize NFS and mount previously created Logical Volume **lv-apps** to the folder where Apache stores files to be served to the users (/var/www).

This approach will make our Web Servers **stateless**, which means we will be able to add new ones or remove them whenever we need, and the integrity of the data (in the database and on NFS) will be preserved.

So on our Web Server1 do the following:

1.  Install NFS client

```
sudo yum install nfs-utils nfs4-acl-tools -y
```

2\. Mount /var/www/ and target the NFS serverΓÇÖs export for apps

```
sudo mkdir /var/www  
sudo mount -t nfs -o rw,nosuid 10.0.0.4:/mnt/apps /var/www   
#replace the IP with your Private NFS Server IP address
```

3\. Verify that NFS was mounted successfully by running df -h. Make sure that the changes will persist on Web Server after reboot:

```
sudo vi /etc/fstab  
#add the lines below, replace the IP with your Private NFS Server IP:  
  
10.0.0.4:/mnt/apps /var/www nfs defaults 0 0
```

4\. Install Apache:

```
sudo yum install httpd -y
```

Run ls /var/www on Web server and youΓÇÖll find folders **cgi-bin html,** then run on NFS server ls /mnt/apps and youΓÇÖll see the same folders.

Repeat steps 1ΓÇô4 for other two Web Servers.

Now make **git init** and then **git clone** this source [code](https://github.com/sokolavdyli/tooling.git) using on your webserver. Go to **tooling** folder, and run the following command to copy html folder content to /var/www/html

```
sudo cp -R html/. /var/www/html
```

Go to WebServers Network Inbound rule and open port 80.

If you encounter 403 Error ΓÇö check permissions to your /var/www/html folder and also disable SELinux **_sudo setenforce 0_** To make this change permanent ΓÇö open following config file **_sudo vi /etc/sysconfig/selinux_** and set **_SELINUX=disabled_** then restrt httpd.

And now we check our WebServer Public IP: 98.66.160.110:80 and we have the result:

Apache test page

Now we remove this test page and provide to clients our app:

1.  Update the websiteΓÇÖs configuration to connect to the database (in /var/www/html/functions.php file). Apply tooling-db.sql script to your database using this command mysql -h -u -p < tooling-db.sql

```
sudo vi /var/www/html/functions.php # m
```10.0.0.8 is the IP of DB Server, webaccess and password are credentials we created above when deployed MySQL

Go to WebServer and run:

```
mysql -h 10.0.0.8 -u webaccess -p tooling < tooling-db.sql
```

If you get an error like this

_ERROR 2059 (HY000): Authentication plugin ΓÇÿcaching\_sha2\_passwordΓÇÖ cannot be loaded: /usr/lib64/mysql/plugin/caching\_sha2\_password.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory_

Then go to you DB Server and add this command to your mysql server

_ALTER USER ΓÇÿwebaccessΓÇÖ@ΓÇÖ10.0.0.0/16' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql\_native\_password BY ΓÇÿpasswordΓÇÖ;_

Try again the above command on Webserver and if you dont get an error you should be good.

Install the following PHP dependencies to your Web Server:

```
sudo yum install httpd -y  
  
sudo dnf install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm  
  
sudo dnf install dnf-utils http://rpms.remirepo.net/enterprise/remi-release-8.rpm  
  
sudo dnf module reset php  
  
sudo dnf module enable php:remi-7.4  
  
sudo dnf install php php-opcache php-gd php-curl php-mysqlnd  
  
sudo systemctl start php-fpm  
  
sudo systemctl enable php-fpm  
  
setsebool -P httpd\_execmem 1
```

Try your webserver now and youΓÇÖll get a login page where you should be able to login with your username created in database
