DEPLOYMENT AUTOMATION WITH CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION - INTRODUCTION TO JENKINS
==========================

In a previous [blogpost](https://sokolavdyli.github.io//posts/2024/01/blog-post-2/), we explored the concept of horizontal scalability, enabling the addition of new Web Servers to our Tooling Website. You've effectively set up a configuration with 2 Web Servers and a Load Balancer to evenly distribute traffic between them. Handling just two or three servers manually isn't a big issue, but imagine repeating this task for dozens or even hundreds of servers.

DevOps revolves around Agility and the swift rollout of software and web solutions. To ensure rapid and consistent deployments, we're initiating the automation of some routine tasks in this project. We'll leverage Jenkins, a free and open-source automation server. It's among the most popular CI/CD tools, originally conceived by former Sun Microsystems developer Kohsuke Kawaguchi and initially named "Hudson."

According to Circle CI, Continuous Integration (CI) is a development strategy that accelerates the pace of development while maintaining code quality. Developers consistently commit code in small increments, usually daily or multiple times a day. This code is then automatically built and tested before merging it with the shared repository.

In our project, we'll harness Jenkins CI capabilities to ensure that any changes made to the source code in GitHub at https://github.com/<your-github-name>/tooling will be automatically reflected on the Tooling Website that we deployed.

##### Here is how our solution diagram will look after we complete it

# INSTALL AND CONFIGURE JENKINS SERVER

First deploy your Azure VM based on Ubuntu Server 20.04 and name it Jenkins. First thing first, run **apt update & apt upgrade**.

Install JDK (since Jenkins is a Java-based application) 

`apt install -y default-jdk-headless`

Install Jenkins by running below commands:

```
wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'
sudo apt update
sudo apt install jenkins
```

If you receive an error something like I had:

`W: GPG error: https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ Release: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 5BA31D57EF5975CA`

then you can do this workaround (please replace your GPG key at the end, mine is **5BA31D57EF5975CA**)

`sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 5BA31D57EF5975CA`

and then run again

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install jenkins
```

Now check if your Jenkins is running 

`sudo systemctl status jenkins`

![](/images//jenkins/jenkinsstatus.png)

By default Jenkins server uses TCP port 8080 – open it by creating a new Inbound Rule in your Network Security Group

![](/images/jenkins/jenkininbound.png)

Now grab your server's public IP on port 8080 you should see Jenkins Unlock page like this 

![](/images/jenkins/unlockjenkins.png)

Run this CLI command and you'll get the initial random password generated for you

`cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword`

On the next page you will be asked which plugings to install – choose suggested plugins.

Create your first Admin User

In this part of below, you'll discover how to set up a basic Jenkins job, also referred to as a project interchangeably. The aim is to configure it to retrieve source codes from GitHub using GitHub webhooks. Once triggered, this job will perform a 'build' task, acquiring codes from GitHub and saving them locally on the Jenkins server.

1. You have to enable Webhooks on your GitHub repository settings

![](/images/githubwebhook.png)
![](/images/githubwebhooksettings.png)

2. Go to Jenkins web console, click "New Item" and create a "Freestyle project"

![](/images/jenkins/freestyle.png)

To establish the connection between Jenkins and your GitHub repository, you'll need to provide the repository's URL. You can easily copy this URL from the repository page itself.

When configuring your Jenkins freestyle project, opt for the Git repository option und Source Code Management. Input the link to your Tooling GitHub repository along with the necessary credentials (username/password). This step ensures that Jenkins gains access to the repository files seamlessly.

![](/images/jenkins/jenkinsprojectconfigure.png)

Once you've completed the configuration, save the settings, and proceed to initiate the build. At this stage, the process can only be executed manually. Locate and click the "Build Now" button. If all configurations are accurate, the build should proceed successfully, and you'll find it listed as #1 among the builds.

![](/images/buildsucess.png)

Once the build is completed, open it and navigate to the "Console Output" to verify if it ran successfully.

If everything looks good, congratulations! You've completed your initial Jenkins build.

However, this build might not generate any output and operates solely when manually triggered. Let's address this by making necessary adjustments.

3. Click "Configure" your job/project and add these two configurations Configure triggering the job from GitHub webhook:

At the **Build Triggers** section checkmark **GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling**. And under the **Post-build Actions** select option **Archive the artifacts** and Files to archive put ** like below image

![](/images/jenkins/actions.png)

Click save. Make changes to a file, such as the README.md, in your GitHub repository, and then push those modifications to the master branch. Observe as a new build is automatically initiated through the webhook, leading to the generation of artifacts that will be saved on the Jenkins server for your review.

![](/images/jenkins/newbuild.png)

We've successfully set up an automated Jenkins job that receives GitHub files triggered by a webhook (known as the 'push' method, where changes are 'pushed' initiating file transfer via GitHub). 

By default, the artifacts generated are stored locally on the Jenkins server.

`ls /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/tooling/builds/<build_number>/archive/`

# Configure Jenkins server to copy files to NFS server via SSH

The next step involves transferring our locally saved artifacts from the Jenkins server to our NFS server, specifically to the /mnt/apps directory.

Jenkins boasts extensive extensibility with over 1400 plugins available. We'll require a specific plugin named "Publish Over SSH" to facilitate this process.

1. To install the "Publish Over SSH" plugin, access the main dashboard and navigate to "Manage Jenkins." From there, select the "Plugins" menu item. Switch to the "Available Plugins" tab and search for the "Publish Over SSH" plugin, then proceed to install it.

![](/images/jenkins/jenkinsplugininstall.png)

2. Configure the job/project to copy artifacts over to NFS server. On main dashboard select "Manage Jenkins" and choose "System" menu item.

Under Publish over SSH field, add your Key from the .pem file you use to authenticate to your Servers. Click SSH Servers add, and insert your NFS Server configuration like below:

![](/images/jenkins/jenkinspushtossh.png)

*Note: Hostname can be either Private or Public IP*

Test the configuration and make sure the connection returns Success. Remember, that TCP port 22 on NFS server must be open to receive SSH connections.

![](/images/jenkins/testssh.png)

Save the configuration, open your Jenkins job/project configuration page and add another one "Post-build Action"

![](/images/jenkins/jenkinsbuildaction.png)

Configure it to send all files probuced by the build into our previouslys define remote directory. In our case we want to copy all files and directories – so we use **.

If you want to apply some particular pattern to define which files to send – use this syntax.

![](/images/jenkins/sendfilesoverssh.png)

Save this configuration and go ahead, change something in README.MD file in your GitHub Tooling repository.

Webhook will trigger a new job and in the "Console Output" of the job you will find something like this:

![](/images/jenkins/consoleoutputssh.png) 

To make sure that the files in /mnt/apps have been udated – connect via SSH/Putty to your NFS server and check README.MD file

`cat /mnt/apps/README.md`

You should be seeing the changes to your NFS Server have been pushed. If you see the changes you had previously made in your GitHub – the job works as expected.

We have just implemented our first Continous Integration solution using Jenkins CI.
