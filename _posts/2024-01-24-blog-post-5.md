Using Ansible to automate our deployment
==========================

On the previous blogposts we have been implementing interesting projects up until now, and I hope that you found those posts useful.

We have been doing some manual operations to setup those virtual servers, install and configure required software, and deploying the Tooling solution web app.

This time, we will be start using even more DevOps tools which I believe you will appreciate by making  most of the routine tasks automated with Ansible Configuration Management, and at the same time we will become confident at writing code using declarative language such as YAML.

### Ansible Client as a Jump Server (Bastion Host) 

An intermediary server, commonly known as a Jump Server or Bastion Host, facilitates access to the internal network. In the current architecture under consideration, the ideal setup involves placing webservers within a secure network, preventing direct access from the Internet. Consequently, even DevOps engineers are unable to SSH directly into the web servers; instead, they can only access them through a Jump Server. This arrangement enhances security and minimizes the attack surface.

In the diagram below, the Virtual Private Network (VPC) is segmented into two subnets. The Public subnet contains public IP addresses, while the Private subnet is exclusively reachable via private IP addresses.

We will see Bastion host in proper action later, for now we will develop Ansible scripts to simulate the use of a Jump box/Bastion host to access our Web Servers.

### INSTALL AND CONFIGURE ANSIBLE ON EC2 INSTANCE

First thing first we will be updating the name tag of our Jenkins server to Jenkins-Ansible since we will use this server to run playbooks.

In our Github account we'll create new repo and name it ansible-config-mgt. 

Let's install Ansible first:

```
sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y

sudo apt install ansible
```

Check your Ansible version by running ansible --version

Go to your Jenkins server, and create a new Freestyle project named ansible (use your learned skills in previous blogposts) and point it to your **ansible-config-mgt** repository.

In your Github repo, configure webhook and set webhook to trigeer ansible build.
Configure a post-build job to save all files, we already showed how to this [Blogpost](https://sokolavdyli.github.io//posts/2024/01/blog-post-3/)

Test your setup by making a simple change on ReadMe file and see if it's triggering a Jenkins job. Also make sure Jenkins server saves the files (building artifacts) in the archive folder 

`ls /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/ansible/builds/<build_number>/archive/`

The setup now will look like this:

**Tip:** To prevent the need for reconfiguring the GitHub webhook every time you stop/start your Jenkins-Ansible server, consider allocating an Elastic IP to your Jenkins-Ansible server. Keep in mind that Elastic IP is free only when allocated to an EC2 Instance. Don't forget to release the Elastic IP once you terminate your EC2 Instance.

Using whatever IDE you prefer (in my case I use VSC) clone your ansible-config-mgt repo to your local workspace

`git clone <ansible-config-mgt repo link>`

### Let's begin Ansible Development

We will be creating new branches in our repository, this to be used for development of new features. For example, if your company uses Jira tool, you can create a branch with your ticket number (eg. PRJ-100) will be the name of the branch and add the topic with a description of what is this branch about - if it's a feature release then feature/prj-100 

`git checkout -b feature/prj-100`

1. Create a folder, name it playbook, this will be used to put playbook files.
2. Create a folder, name it inventory, to kep your hosts organized.

Inside playbook folder, create a file named common.yml, and inside inventory folder create dev.yml, staging.yml, uat.yml and prod.yml

- An Ansible Inventory file defines the hosts and groups of hosts on which commands, modules, and tasks in a playbook operate. Our intention is to execute Linux commands on remote hosts and ensure that the intended configuration on a particular server occurs. Organizing our hosts in such an inventory is crucial for this purpose. Since it is important to have a way to ensure that it is the intended configuration on a particular server that occurs, and our intention is to execute Linux commands on remote hosts.

Now, we have to update SSH agent and connect VS code to our Jenkins-Ansible instance: 

- Go to the folder where your .pem file is and run 
```
eval `ssh-agent -s`
ssh-add <path-to-private-key>
```
Then go to your server and and access it through

`ssh -A ubuntu@jenkinsansible-public-ip`

and confirm the key has been added, the name of your key will appear
`ssh-add -l`

Go to your inventory/dev.yaml file that you created and paste:

```
[nfs]
<NFS-Server-Private-IP-Address> ansible_ssh_user='ec2-user'

[webservers]
<Web-Server1-Private-IP-Address> ansible_ssh_user='ec2-user'
<Web-Server2-Private-IP-Address> ansible_ssh_user='ec2-user'

[db]
<Database-Private-IP-Address> ansible_ssh_user='ubuntu' 

[lb]
<Load-Balancer-Private-IP-Address> ansible_ssh_user='ubuntu'
```
## Create the playbook file config

With the common playbook file we instruct Ansible what has to be performed on all servers we listed above. Within the playbook named common.yml, you'll author configurations for tasks that are repeatable, reusable, and applicable to multiple machines within the infrastructure. 

```
- name: update web, nfs servers
  hosts: webservers, nfs
  remote_user: ec2-user
  become: yes
  become_user: root
  tasks:
    - name: ensure wireshark is at the latest version
      yum:
        name: wireshark
        state: latest

- name: update LB and db server
  hosts: lb, db
  remote_user: ubuntu
  become: yes
  become_user: root
  tasks:
    - name: Update apt repo
      apt: 
        update_cache: yes

    - name: ensure wireshark is at the latest version
      apt:
        name: wireshark
        state: latest
```

The above code tells us that Ansible will login to each our servers and deploy wireshark. Push the updated files/folders to our branch feature/prj-100
