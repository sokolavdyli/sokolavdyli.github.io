## Hi,

I'm Sokol, a tech lover since first day I met my [i386 Pentium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I386) in 1998 as a 11 years old boy receiving it as a gift from my dad.
Back on these old days I found love with tech, MS-DOS was my playaround OS lol. I still remember the floppy disks with the game of Prince of Persia playing for hours.

Moving on to high school and the passion about technology was always growing within me. At those times I remember forums became a popular place to dig and get into different stuff about tech, starting from programming, social media, hacking (lulz) etc.

Everyone says that time as a university student is the best, and I can't agree more. Finished the Bachelor Degree of Computer Science at [SEE-U unversity](https://seeu.edu.mk/)

Plans are to use this blog to share anything related to tech, but since I'm in the start of switching my career from experienced Network Engineer to DevOps / Cloud field, my plans are to share some projects that I'm working into.

I hope you find these stuff helpful and please reach out to my email for sugesstion or LinkedIn to connect.  Thank you for your visit ðŸ˜‰
